Python File Handling Project - IP Allow List Update
Project Overview
This project involves a Python script designed to update an "allow list" of IP addresses for a healthcare company. The script reads a list of currently allowed IP addresses and a list of IPs to be removed. It then updates the allow list by removing the specified IP addresses and writes the updated list back to the file.

Features
Reads IP addresses from a file.
Removes specified IP addresses based on a remove list.
Writes the updated list back to the original file.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Files in the Project
update_allow_list.py: The main Python script for updating the allow list.
allow_list.txt: Text file containing the current list of allowed IP addresses.
remove_list.txt: Text file containing the list of IP addresses to be removed from the allow list.
How to Run the Script
Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
Place the update_allow_list.py, allow_list.txt, and remove_list.txt files in the same directory.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using Python:
Copy code
python update_allow_list.py
The script will read the IP addresses from allow_list.txt, remove the addresses found in remove_list.txt, and update allow_list.txt with the remaining addresses.
Customisation
You can modify the allow_list.txt and remove_list.txt files to reflect the actual IP addresses you wish to manage.
